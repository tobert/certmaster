Note for https://github.com/tobert/certmaster fork: upstream has a few
restrictions that I don't have at all. I have restrictions on how much
time I can spend on supporting ancient rhel distros, so I'm simply working
in master for now to get something deployable. If this becomes something
I'm using in production, I'll be able to get the time to merge all of this
back to upstream in a sensible way.
